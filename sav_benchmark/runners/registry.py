"""Registry utilities for model/prompt runners to enable modular expansion.

Each model family (e.g., sam2, edgetam, future models) exposes a dict mapping
prompt type strings (e.g., "points", "bbox") to a callable runner with the
standard signature used throughout the benchmark. New models can register
themselves by calling ``register_model_family(name, runners_dict)`` from their
module's import side-effect or an initialization block.

The benchmark core will consult this registry to resolve a (model_name,prompt)
pair to a concrete runner. This removes the need to specialâ€‘case model names
in the main pipeline when adding future methods.
